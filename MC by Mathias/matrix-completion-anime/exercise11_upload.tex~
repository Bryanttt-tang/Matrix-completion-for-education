\section{Problem 1}

Thanks to your incredible performance in de-noising the distress signals Mathias sent out, the ATIC team has managed to inverse-Laplace transform him back into normal space.
Unfortunately, while he was still transcending space and time, he had acausally watched all English-language media ever made.
In order for him to survive the quarantine, he has to branch out into other media.
Using your optimization skills, you will now have to recommend him the best possible Japanese anime.
\medskip

You will find two datasets: \texttt{anime\_upload.csv} contains 11153 different animes, each with a unique ID number that  doesn't necessarily go from 1--11153, the anime title, and a list of genres that the anime belongs to.
The second dataset, \texttt{rating\_upload.csv}, contains data from 73516 users of a popular anime streaming website.
A user had the option of watching an anime, and then rating it from 1--10. 
If a user watched but did not rate the anime, a score of `-1' was recorded.
\medskip

We will model the task of constructing recommendations as a rank-minimization problem.
Let $X$ be a matrix whose rows correspond to users, and whose columns correspond to animes.
The entry $X_{ij}$ is the $i$th user's opinion on the anime $j$.
We will be using the nuclear norm as a proxy for the rank of $X$.
Lastly, let $\Omega =\{(i,j)~|~\text{anime $j$ is rated by user $i$}\}$ be the set of ratings that we know.
For example, $M_{ij}$ is the $i$th user's known rating of anime $j$ out of 10.

Our optimization problem is thus
\begin{align}
  \begin{array}{ll}
    \min_{X} & \|X\|_*\\
    \mathrm{s.t.} & X_{ij} = M_{ij},~\forall~(i,j)\in \Omega.
  \end{array}\label{eq:1} \tag{P1}
\end{align}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $M_{ij}$ be the numerical rating out of 10 that user $i$ assigns to anime $j$, and solve Problem~\eqref{eq:1}.
    Ignore all entries of `-1', i.e.~don't set them to anything as they are not in $\Omega$.
    What is the resulting recommendation for user 1337 for the anime \textit{Pokemon: Slowking no Ichinichi}?
  \item Mathias has watched only a few animes in his life. His ratings for them are in Table~\ref{tab:anime}.
    Add a new row to $X$ corresponding to Mathias.
    Given his ratings in Table~\ref{tab:anime}, what are the top 5 animes he should watch?
    \begin{table}
      \centering
      \begin{tabular}{||c|c||}\hline
        Anime & Rating\\\hline\hline
        Steins;Gate & 10\\\hline
        Steins;Gate 0& 8\\\hline
        Shinsekai yori & 5\\\hline
        Serial Experiments Lain & 10\\\hline
        Perfect Blue & 6.5 \\ \hline
        Paprika & 6 \\\hline
      \end{tabular}
      \caption{Mathias' anime ratings}
      \label{tab:anime}
    \end{table}
 \item Notice that most of the animes in Table~\ref{tab:anime} are of the Sci-Fi genre.
   Solve problem~\eqref{eq:1} using data \emph{only} from animes that are tagged as being Sci-Fi.
   If there are any zero columns or zero rows in your matrix $X$, make sure to re-define $X$ in such a way that these rows and columns are removed.
   What are the top 5 Sci-Fi  animes Mathias should watch?
   Print out a list of all animes (names, not anime IDs) that are expected for Mathias to rate higher than a 6, and save it as \texttt{Surname\_recommendations.txt}.
   Upload this with your solution.
\item Mathias' otaku friend Sara forced him to watch \emph{Mahou Shoujo Madoka$\star$Magica} with her, and he liked it so much he gave it a 9. Add this rating to your solution to Part (2) (the case with all the data).
  Do the recommendations for the top 5 animes from part (2) he should watch change?
  Is this a user-friendly or desired feature?
  Discuss any business consequences.
\item What happens if you try a binary recommendation strategy, i.e. if a user $i$ rated an anime $j$ 6 or more, then set $M_{ij}=1$ and zero otherwise.
  What happens to the recommendations for Mathias compared to part (2)? 
  Is this a better classifier method?
  \textbf{Hint:} Think about how subjective ratings can be, and how the scales differ from person to person, and also the loss of information by doing this.
\end{enumerate}

% \section{Problem 2}

% Goran is trying to land his spaceship near his vacation home on \emph{Utopia Planitia}, but since he is cheap, he wants to do it with the minimum fuel possible.
% Solve the minimum-fuel descent problem,
% \begin{align}
%   \begin{array}{ll}
%     \min & \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \|f_k\|_2^2\\
%     \mathrm{s.t.} & p_0 = p(0),~v_0 = \dot{p}(0)\\
%          & v_{k+1} = v_k + \frac{h}{m}f_k - hge_3\\
%          & p_{k+1} = p_k + \frac{h}{2}(v_k + v_{k+1})\\
%          & \|f_k\|_2 \leq F^{\max}\\
%          & (p_k)_3 \geq \|((p_k)_1,(p_k)_2)\|_2\\
%          & p_K=0,~v_K=0.
%   \end{array}
% \end{align}

% The parameters are given as follows:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item $g = 3.711$ m/s$^2$, since this is Mars.
%   \item $p(0) = ()$
% \end{itemize}
